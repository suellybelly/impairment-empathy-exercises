# impairment-empathy-exercises

Initial brief 13/03/20201
## Visual impairment empathy building game
### Summary
This project is an informational website to a local event in a fictitious town. The user of this website will be presented with a few tasks that an average festival-goer will want to do, such as find out the event venue and event dates.
### Details
1. Blindness simulation: The whole website will be masked with a opaque black overlay, meaning that the website will appear to be blank with a black background.
2. Screen reader simulation: With each keyboard interaction a caption which attempts to mimic a screen reader’s speech will appear as caption on the screen.
3. Way finding GUI for the sighted user: Information such as tasks to complete and the timer will still be visible to inform the sighted user of their progress.
4. Gamification factor: The user’s score is determined by the number of tasks completed within the time limit. Completion of a task is determined by the user submitting the correct answer for each task
5. Empathy lesson: The sighted user will likely feel frustrated or get stuck while performing these tasks. There will be a toggle switch for “blindness simulation mode”. There will be guiding prompts such as “Did you find yourself memorising the number of tab presses to get to a button?”
6. Call to action:
- Encourage users to perform an audit on their favourite website (link to axe-core free browser extension)
- Empower users with knowledge by recommending courses (link to deque University)
- Empower users with knowledge by sharing the official document: (link to WCAG website)

## Website ideas
- A way to view a schedule
- Add a "Map" section for festival venue address (e.g. Google maps), and festival map (e.g. SVG) to highlight potential challenges in map reading for blind users on the web.
